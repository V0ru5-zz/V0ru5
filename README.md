# Introduction
**Welcome to my profile**

I'm a random Protogen who wants to code some things, mostly just knows a little Python, and keeps abandoning the small projects I decide to start. Not really anything here currently, but if I do anything interesting, or anything on Github in general, I'll add it here.
